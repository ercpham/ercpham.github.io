### About Me

This is a rather large picture of myself. I don't update it very often, but you can find more pictures of me [on my Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/the_eric_pham/).


### Completing the Assignment

The requirements for this assignment specify _"Pictures"_ in plural, so I guess I'll add another one.

That's a good looking chicken sandwich. It was from **Howling Ray's in L.A**. I highly recommend, probably the best chicken sandwich I've ever had.

### Code

I'm currently pursuing a B.S. in computer science at UCSD, so naturally, I code.

Here's a block of code for the extremely slow way to get a number from the Fibonnaci sequence.

```javascript
const fib = (n) => {
    if (n === 1)
        return 1;
    if (n === 2)
        return 1;
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
}
```

What a great demonstration of my skills.

1. They keep things organized
2. People are very familiar with lists
3. They allow you to complete the assignment
4. Need I say more?
